Hi world. I am trying this weird editor from the command line.
Why? Because it seems that some people like it and they will judge you if you can't or don't use it.
So, let's not only try it, but also master it!

Chao!
ESC: switch back to command mode
ESC then v -> to select text visually. When done selecting, ESC then y to copy or ESC then d to cut/delete
ESC then p -> paste selected text
ESC then i -> insert text
ESC then :wq -> save and quit
ESC then :q! -> quit without saving
ESC then :help -> to get help
